This 'luasopia' is a wrapper library on CoronaSDK and Gideros. The purpose of this library is for the same Lua code to result in the same output on both Solar2d( former CoronaSDK) and Gideros. Thus, if a user writes a code (e.g., game) using this library, it can be executed without any modification on Gideros and Solar2d. It also results in the same output in both environments.
