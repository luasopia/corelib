This 'luasopia' is a wrapper library on CoronaSDK and Gideros. The purpose of this library is that the same lua code result in the same output on both CoronaSDK and Gideros. Thus, if a user writes a code (e.g., game) using this library, it can be executed without any modification on Gideros as well as Corona and results in the same output.
